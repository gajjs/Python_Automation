Great! Setting up a **CI/CD pipeline** for your PyCharm + GitHub Python project is a powerful step forward.

Letâ€™s walk through how to set up **CI/CD using GitHub Actions**, which is built-in, free, and works perfectly with Python projects.

---

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step: Set Up CI/CD for a Python Project Using GitHub Actions

---

### âœ… **1. Create the GitHub Actions Workflow**

Inside your PyCharm project, create the following directory and file:

**Path:** `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`

---

### ðŸ“„ `python-ci.yml` Example (Basic CI Workflow)

```yaml
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi

    - name: Run Pytest
      run: |
        pytest
```

---

### âœ… **2. Add `requirements.txt` and Tests**

In your PyCharm project root, make sure you have:

* A `requirements.txt` file with all your dependencies:

  ```
  pytest
  requests
  # Add any other packages here
  ```

* A test folder (e.g. `tests/` or `Pytest_topics/`) with test files like:

  ```python
  def test_sample():
      assert 1 + 1 == 2
  ```

---

### âœ… **3. Commit and Push Workflow File**

In terminal:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/python-ci.yml
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI pipeline"
git push
```

---

### âœ… **4. See It in Action on GitHub**

Go to your GitHub repo:

* Click on the **Actions** tab.
* You will see your workflow running.
* It installs dependencies, runs tests, and reports success/failure.

---

## ðŸ§ª Bonus: Add Badges to README.md

```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/gajjs/Python_Automation/actions/workflows/python-ci.yml/badge.svg)
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ Optional CI/CD Add-Ons:

* **Linting**: Add `flake8` or `pylint` to the workflow.
* **Deployment**: Extend the workflow to deploy to AWS, Heroku, or Docker Hub.
* **Coverage**: Add code coverage reports using `coverage.py` + `codecov`.

---

Would you like help:

* Writing a more advanced pipeline (with build/lint/test)?
* Deploying code automatically after CI passes?

Let me know your goal for the pipeline!
